Project Overview
A comprehensive database and monitoring system tracking air quality across Bangladesh, developed by Arowa Mahbub Arshi from Metropolitan University. The system collects, analyzes, and visualizes air quality data to support environmental management and public health initiatives.

Key Features
Multi-parameter Monitoring: Tracks PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, O3

Meteorological Integration: Records temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed

AQI Calculation: Computes real-time Air Quality Index for each station

Advanced Analytics: Entropy analysis for pattern recognition

Alert System: Automatic notifications when thresholds are exceeded

Maintenance Tracking: Complete station maintenance history

Geospatial Analysis: Data organized by divisions and districts
